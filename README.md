# 🧠 HSN Code Validation and Suggestion Agent

A smart agent that validates and suggests HSN codes based on product descriptions using Flask, Dialogflow, and React. This system is designed to support tax compliance, B2B invoicing, and customs documentation by intelligently guiding users through accurate HSN classification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ HSN Code Validation with format and hierarchy checks
- 🔍 HSN Code Suggestion using fuzzy matching for product descriptions
- 💬 Dialogflow Integration for natural language interaction
- 🌐 React Frontend for local usage and testing
- ⚡ Real-time Response System with context-aware responses
- 🧾 Uses `HSN_Master_Data.xlsx` as the core dataset

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hsn-agent.git
cd hsn-agent
````

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask App

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Start the React Frontend (Optional)

```bash
cd hsn-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 🧠 Dialogflow Integration

This system connects with Dialogflow to power conversational HSN code validation and suggestion.

### ▶️ Run `app.py` Locally (for Development)

```bash
python app.py
```

* This will start a Flask server at `http://localhost:5000`.
* Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose it for Dialogflow:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

* Paste the HTTPS URL from ngrok (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`) into **Dialogflow → Fulfillment → Webhook URL**.

### ☁️ Deploy to Google Cloud (Production)

This project is configured for GCP App Engine.

#### Steps:

1. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Set project:

   ```bash
   gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
   ```

3. Deploy:

   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml
   ```

4. Copy the endpoint URL and use it in your Dialogflow webhook configuration.
