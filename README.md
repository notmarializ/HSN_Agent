# 🧠 HSN Code Validation and Suggestion Agent

A smart HSN Code assistant that validates and suggests HSN codes based on product descriptions using a combination of Flask, Dialogflow, and React. This project is designed for integration into tax compliance, invoicing, and government systems, ensuring efficient and accurate HSN code usage.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **HSN Code Validation** based on format and hierarchical structure
- 🔍 **Intelligent Code Suggestion** using fuzzy matching of product descriptions
- 💬 **Dialogflow Agent Integration** for conversational interface
- ⚡ **Real-time Query Processing** with context-aware responses
- 🌐 **React-based Frontend** for local web UI usage
- 🧾 Uses an Excel Master Sheet as source for HSN data

🧠 Dialogflow Integration
This project integrates with Dialogflow CX or ES to provide an intelligent, voice/chat-driven HSN Code Assistant.

🔌 Webhook Fulfillment via app.py
▶️ Run Locally (for testing or tunnel to Dialogflow using ngrok)
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This starts a Flask server to receive webhook calls from Dialogflow.

You can tunnel your local server using ngrok:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 5000
Copy the forwarded HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io) and paste it into the Webhook URL section in your Dialogflow agent’s Fulfillment settings.

☁️ Deploy to Google Cloud (Production)
This project is GCP-ready with the app.yaml file.

Steps to Deploy:

Authenticate your GCP CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud auth login
Set the GCP project:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
Deploy to App Engine:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud app deploy app.yaml
Once deployed, use the deployed endpoint URL as your webhook URL in Dialogflow.

Note: Ensure the deployed webhook meets Dialogflow’s requirements for HTTPS, response time, and request formatting.
